{% block helpcontent %}
<p>This pie chart shows the sizes of the different parts of your text, as identified by <span class="brand openessayist">openEssayist</span>.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that a "word count" is not an accurate operation: it depends on how you define a "word". Different software will have slightly different counts. So don't be surprise if the numbers given on the graph are not exactly the same as on your own text.</p>
